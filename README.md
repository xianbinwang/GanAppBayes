# GanAppBayes
It is an application of variational inference and neural network GAN structure.
The target is to generate random samples from a posterior distribution, which usually has no explicit form or is hard to sample.
For a specific posterior distribution, the sampling performance depends on the generator structure and the distribution of the input noise. 
For different posterior distributions, based on your knowledge, you should design a different generator structure and choose a proper noise.
